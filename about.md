My name is Erik Pereyra. I am a Public History Master's student. I am Dominican-American. I was born and raised in Boston, Massachusetts. I just beat the game Elden Ring for the first time. 

### More Information

My research interest right now is studying how metanarratives have shaped public history. Though I feel a bit out of my depth at times, I feel like I am learning more about this subject. I started looking into this because I felt that some important events of Boston's past were not as well chronicled and consumed as others.

#### My lists!
1. my semester right now is going well
2. Today I had to get gas for the car in case the storm was intense.
3. Other than thar, I've been working on other assignments and homework.
